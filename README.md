# AucklandBusApplication

App created due to the current offering of official AT bus applications in NZ feeling like they lacked intuitive features.
Uses Google Maps API and AuckalndTransport API.

## Planned features
- Based on map view. User should see map of current location with stops when opening app
- Quickly view list of saved/favourite stops and view realtime board
- Select stop on map and view realtime board
- Store user saved map positions for later use
- Quickly press button to go to current location, at a zoom level to see stops available


## TODO
- Implement adding stops from text input
- Implement map positions
- Update favourites to show more information than just stop number
- Allow user to rename favourite stops and map positions


## ToBuild
Missing Auckland Transport API keys, as well as Google Maps API keys required for full functioning of the application.
- Auckland Transport API keys should be put into app/src/main/java/com.tosw164.busapp.atapi.ATapiKey.java
- Missing Google Maps API key, should be placed in app.debug.res.values.google_maps_api.xml


As of starting the project, Auckland Transport has created an updated transport application.
